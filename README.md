## Installation
Install [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases) *(recommended)*
```
electron-v*-linux-x64.zip
electron-v*-win32-x64.zip
```
Clone
```
git clone https://github.com/nimadez/voxel-builder
cd voxel-builder
```
Run
```
# Start with Electron:
electron .

# Start with Node.js:
node server.js
```
Update
```
cd voxel-builder
python3 update.py
```

## Supported Browsers
- Electron *(recommended)*
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
> - PWA A2HS-ready *(add to home screen)*
> - For the best experience, a tablet with pen or Wacom is recommended

## Known Issues
Higher than 512K is not recommended
```
Electron is recommended for working with a large number of voxels

Higher values can have the following problems:
- Intolerable delay when starting the renderer
- Chrome tab may freeze or crash

Of course, the number of voxels is unlimited,
I have rendered up to 1 million voxels.
```
Failed to import GLB meshes for voxelization
```
Multiple meshes need to have the same properties or they won't merge,
the only solution is to merge meshes before exporting to GLB.
```
Wacom tablet crashes randomly and throws warning on Linux (GNOME)
```
Warning: BJS - Max number of touches exceeded. Ignoring touches in excess of 2.
This problem is related to Babylon.js and nothing can be done.
```
Error: Exceeded the quota
```
Browser storage is limited, use Electron for much higher capacity.
```

## FAQ
How to go back to the previous version?
```
git clone https://github.com/nimadez/voxel-builder
cd voxel-builder
git log -2 (copy the hash of the previous commit)
git reset --hard $HASH
```
How to merge vertices after export to GLB?
```
1- Open exported GLB file in Blender
2- Go to "Modeling" tab and choose vertex selection mode
3- Select all vertices (Ctrl + A)
4- Mesh > Clean Up > Merge by Distance
```
How to run Blender importer script?
```
1- Save project to JSON
2- Open Blender and go to "Scripting" tab
3- Click "Open" and select "blender-importer.py"
4- Run the script and select a JSON file
```

## History
```
↑ Core initialization
↑ Rendering was left to three and three-gpu-pathtracer
↑ ES6 (the original index.html playground was moved)
↑ x1.5 faster startup (2s to 300ms)
↑ Migrating to Linux: Firefox ready
↑ High performance GPU picking system
↑ Voxel engine updated to thin-instances (64k to 512k)
↑ The world moved (from 0.0 to 0.5 center to avoid 0.5)
↑ Real-time GPU path tracing
↑ Introducing ES modules
↑ Advancing to the next level (bakery)
↑ Changed default handiness to right-handed coordinate
↑ New SPS particles to build the world
↑ 2019 - I wrote a playground for learning Babylon.js
```
